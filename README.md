Have a stupid word on your github graph, draw whatever you want by running `web/` and `server/` and going to `localhost:5173`

### How do I do it?

For now you need to run web and server by yourself and create your repo to store the commits, better instructions at some point...

### Todo

- styling web
- [x] year dropdown
- [x] pass year info to script via server
- install script (initiate web and server and guide user)
- new readme
- drawing by moving mouse and not only clicking
